    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <div class="experience">
      <h4>Dovetail Software</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="title">
          Senior Software Engineer
        </li>
        <li class="time">
          April 2011 - Present
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>

      <p>
        I worked closely with a small team to produce and support the Dovetail Support Center for HR. My responsibilities included product feature work, mentoring junior staff, providing technical architecture direction, streamlining deployments and UI work.</p>
      <p>I choose to take this job because of the reputation for a high commitment to software development quality, an intense focus on testing, and compositional programming. I was pushed to grow as a developer, and in return I was able to bring the architectural and people skills from my former position.</p>

    <div class="experience">
      <h4>Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="title">
          Solution Architect
        </li>
        <li class="time">
          May 2007 - April 2011
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>

      <p>
        I worked with the Enterprise Architect to plan and build over 90 different internal applications to support various business processes; including a data warehouse, various data retention plans, and several line of business applications. I supervised the code quality of 15 different developers to make sure our software principles were maintained while still meeting the business’ need for applications to be delivered. As a staff position I had to provide a business value reason for most of my recommendations, rather than direct edicts.
      </p><p>
        I choose this job because I would be leading a team of developers in producing software that managed $56 billion in assets. While at the bank, I was pushed to explain technical concepts in terms that CXOs and VPs could understand, while at the same time making sure technical decisions were in lock step with the business’s long term goals.
